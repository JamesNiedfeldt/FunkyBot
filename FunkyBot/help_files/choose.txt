Here's how to use `!choose`:

Send `!choose [[X|Y|...]]` to have me choose from your options.
- For example, to choose from cats or dogs, you should send: `!choose [[cats|dogs]]`.
- I need at least two choices to choose from, but you can send up to ten.
- Make sure you separate each choice by using the | character.
