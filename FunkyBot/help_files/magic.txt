Here's how to use `!magic`:

Send `!magic [[X]]` to have me search for a Magic: The Gathering card.
- For example, to search for Island, you should send: `!magic [[island]]`.
- I can search for up to three cards, just make sure they are all in the same double brackets and separate them with the | character.
