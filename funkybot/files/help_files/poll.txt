Here's how to use `!poll`:

Send `!poll [[X|Y|...]]` to have me start a poll with the given options.
> - When the poll is running, people can vote on the choices by increasing corresponding reactions that I add to the poll message. Adding new reactions will not do anything.
> - I can't prevent people from voting multiple times, so use the honor system!
> - The poll will automatically run for one hour, but you can end it early by sending `!end` in the same channel.
> - When the poll is concluded, I will display the results.
> - You can set a custom poll question by typing anywhere in the message outside the brackets.
> - I need at least two options, but you can send up to ten.
> - You can only run a single poll per channel at a time.
> - For example, to poll people on what their favorite color is, send `!poll What is your favorite color? [[Red|Yellow|Blue]]`
