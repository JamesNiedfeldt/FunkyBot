Here's how to use `!help`:

This is the command you're using! Send `!help [[X]]` to have me explain a command in detail.
- For example, to get an explanation of the `!binary` command, you should send: `!help [[!binary]]`.
- You can also send just the name of the command without the ! character.
- I can only send an explanation of one command at a time.
- For commands with options in double brackets, you just need to send the name of the command. Don't send any brackets.
