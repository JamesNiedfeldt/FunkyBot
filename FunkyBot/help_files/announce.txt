Here's how to use `!announce`:

Send `!announce [[x|x|x]]` to have me send everyone a notification after the set time.
- Time can be set with s(econds), m(inutes), h(ours), and d(ays).
- Time cannot exceed 30 days.
- Separate each argument in the brackets with the | character.
- I can only take the first three arguments you give me.
- You can set a custom message by typing anywhere in the message outside the brackets.
- If you enter arguments wrong, I will set a default time.
- For example, to remind everyone to join you in a game in 2 and a half days, send `!announce [[2d|12h]] play game`.
- Only server administrators can use this command.
