Here's how to use `!remind`:

Send `!remind [[x|x|x]]` to have me send a notification to you after the set time.
- Time can be set with s(econds), m(inutes), h(ours), and d(ays).
- Time cannot exceed 30 days.
- Separate each argument in the brackets with the | character.
- I can only take the first three arguments you give me.
- You can set a custom message by typing anywhere in the message outside the brackets.
- If you enter arguments wrong, I will set a default time.
- For example, to set a reminder to go to sleep in 2 and a half hours, send `!remind [[2h|30m]] go to sleep`.
