Here's how to use `!announce`:

Send `!announce [[x|x|x]]` to have me send everyone a notification after the set time.
> - Time can be set with s(econds), m(inutes), h(ours), and d(ays).
> - Time cannot exceed 30 days.
> - Separate each argument in the brackets with the | character.
> - I can only take the first three arguments you give me.
> - You can set a custom message by typing anywhere in the message outside the brackets.
> - For example, to remind everyone to join you in a game in 2 and a half days, send `!announce [[2d|12h]] play game`.
> - Only server administrators can use this command.

You can also use a special format to set an announcement for a certain date.
> - You must supply the date, time, and timezone as a UTC offset.
> - Date should be format `MM/DD/YYYY`
> - Time should be format `HH:MM` as a 24 hour clock.
> - UTC offset should be format `(+/-)HHHH`.
> - The date you set cannot be before the current date and time.
> - I can only take one argument in this format.
> - You can set a custom message by typing anywhere in the message outside the brackets.
> - For example, to set an announcement for May 20, 2021 at 2:30 PM US Mountain Time, send `!announce [[05/20/2021 14:30 -0600]]`.
