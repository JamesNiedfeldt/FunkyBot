Here's how to use `!wiki`:

Send `!wiki [[X]]` to have me search for a Wikipedia article.
> - For example, to search for "shiba inu", you should send: `!wiki [[shiba inu]]`.
> - I can only search for one article at a time.
> - I can't screen the content I find, so please don't break server rules by searching for certain articles!
