Here's how to use `!magic`:

Send `!magic [[X]]` to have me search for a Magic: The Gathering card.
> - For example, to search for Island, you should send: `!magic [[island]]`.
> - I can also search for a random card using the word "random". For example: `!magic [[random]]`.
> - You can also use Scryfall's syntax to add search terms to random as long as they don't use the `|` character. For example, to search for a random red and green commander, you should send: `!magic [[random c=rg is:commander]]`.
> - I can search for up to three cards, just make sure they are all in the same double brackets and separate them with the | character.
