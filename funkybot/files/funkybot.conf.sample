# Bot token for logging in
# This can be found on the bot page of your Discord Developer Portal.
# FunkyBot cannot connect to Discord without this token.
token=

# User information for making API requests
#
# request_name and request_email are used for creating the user agent header
# when the bot makes API requests. They are there in case the owners of the APIs
# need someone to contact, though this is extremely unlikely as FunkyBot under 
# normal use does not make many API requests.
#
# These properties are required even if the !magic and !wiki command are both disabled,
# though they won't be used.
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# request_name=Firstname Lastname
# request_email=email@email.com
request_name=
request_email=

# Toggle certain commands on/off
#
# If any of these commands are disabled, they will not appear in command lists and can't be
# called. These values must be either true or false. Only !announce, !magic, and !wiki are listed
# here as they either tag everyone or send API requests, but any command can go here and be 
# toggled if you choose. If a command is not present, it is enabled by default.
#
# DEFAULT:
# announce=true
# magic=true
# wiki=true
announce=true
magic=true
wiki=true

# Toggle message deletion of picture post commands
#
# If any of these are set to true, the message sent to call them will be deleted by FunkyBot
# if it has the proper permissions on the channel the command was called from. If the property
# is enabled but FunkyBot doesn't have permission, it will simply post the picture normally.
# These values must be either 'true' or 'false'.
#
# DEFAULT:
# cute_delete=false
# react_delete=true
cute_delete=false
react_delete=true

# Maximum values for commands
#
# These properties change maximum values used by certain commands. These values must be integers
# and cannot be blank. Each property has a valid range of values:
#
# roll_max_args: min 1, max 10
# choose_max_args: min 2, max 10
# binary_max_args: min 1, max 10
# hex_max_args: min 1, max 10
# time_max_duration: min 1, max 30 (in days)
# poll_run_duration: min 1, max 10 (in hours)
#
# DEFAULT:
# roll_max_args=5
# choose_max_args=10
# binary_max_args=3
# hex_max_args=3
# time_max_duration=30
# poll_run_duration=3
roll_max_args=5
choose_max_args=10
binary_max_args=3
hex_max_args=3
time_max_duration=30
poll_run_duration=3

# What currency to display with the !magic command
# 
# Must be either 'usd', 'eur', or 'tix'. It can be left blank only if the !magic command is disabled.
#
# DEFAULT:
# magic_currency=usd
magic_currency=usd
