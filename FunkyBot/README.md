This is a personal project, not meant as a public bot 
but use the code if you want.

Not included in the repository are:
- Reaction pics (add pictures you want)
- Shiba pics (add pictures you want)
- token.txt (this is necessary for the bot to log in;
	it should only contain the login token for the bot
	found on your Discord developer page for the bot)

As I said before, this bot is not public. For it to work
you need to create your own bot on Discord and add the
token accordingly.
